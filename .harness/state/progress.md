# Progress

Append-only history. Newest at the top. This is what a fresh session reads to find out what
happened, what was verified, and what to do next.

Every entry records **which gates ran and which did not**. The second half is the part a
reader cannot reconstruct.

## 2026-08-14 — Phase 2b: design system approved · frontend foundation decided

**Scope:** the Stage 1 wireframes were rejected, the design was rebuilt, and the frontend
foundation question was researched and settled. No application code.

### The rejection, and what was wrong

Stage 1 wireframes came back as *"very bad — they lack design thinking and creativity."*
That was correct.

**The error:** C1 (*the interface must not decorate with colour*) was read as a reason to
remove things. The output was structurally sound and lifeless — a spec document with the word
*wireframe* on it. The constraint was treated as a limit to work within rather than as the
direction to work toward.

**What was actually true:** the references supplied — efferd, coss, and the fashion-retail
canon — all converge on neutral chrome, greyscale data, chroma held back. That is not a
compromise those designers accepted; it is what a product whose subject carries the colour
genuinely wants. Captured as
[[the-constraint-and-the-taste-usually-agree]], and it is why
[`visual-taste`](../skills/visual-taste/SKILL.md) now exists.

### Design system — approved

Rebuilt on the thesis **soft chrome, exact colour**: everything generous — 20px cards, 28px
containers, full pills, 44px targets, warm neutrals — except `radius.swatch: 0`, forever.
Surrounded by softness the hard edge reads as deliberate precision, and that tension is the
idea.

Framing: **a colour page is a product page, and here the colour is the product.** The swatch
takes the treatment a garment photograph gets; the specification sits quiet beneath it.

Taken and refused deliberately rather than blended: **deference** and 44px targets from Apple
HIG, **refusing** translucency near a swatch; **tonal elevation** and soft geometry from
Material 3, **refusing** dynamic colour outright — deriving a UI palette from a source colour
would tint the whole interface from the thing being examined.

`design-system.manifest.json` now carries **real values**, `status: "approved"`, and rules a
general-purpose system would have no reason to encode: `swatch.well` as a mandatory neutral
ground · `chromaCeiling` of 0.01 on surfaces and text · `foreground.3` marked
`largeTextOnly` because it fails AA at small sizes · greyscale `chart.1…5` · `cvdPairs`.
**The `contrast` gate is blocking from the moment it exists (F-003).**

### Frontend foundation — [ADR-0033](../../docs/adr/0033-frontend-foundation-own-the-token-layer-headless-primitives.md)

**Astryx evaluated and not adopted.** It is genuinely good — 150+ accessible components, an
MCP server, and Tailwind integration better engineered than expected (pre-compiled CSS,
explicit `@layer` ordering, a token bridge).

**It is web-only, and that is decisive.** Our manifest compiles to four targets including
React Native precisely so web and mobile cannot drift; adopting Astryx would split the design
system down the middle of the product, with the Lens on the far side. Its theme packages also
own the colour semantics that are this product's substance.

**Taken from it anyway:** its best idea is not its components — it is the MCP server letting
an agent browse the design system. Recorded as a backlog candidate for our own tokens.

Token names stay shadcn/Base-UI compatible so tweakcn, efferd and coss blocks remain usable
as reference. Interoperability, not adoption. **Radix vs Base UI to settle before F-017.**

### Skills adopted

Three published design skills **read and adapted**, not installed — per
[ADR-0029](../../docs/adr/0029-harness-agnostic-core-thin-adapter.md) we adapt and record
provenance. Rather than five overlapping skill files, each source went where it belonged:

| Source | Into | Adaptation |
|---|---|---|
| taste-skill (MIT, Leonxlnx) | **new** [`visual-taste`](../skills/visual-taste/SKILL.md) | Anti-generic discipline bound to *this* subject: the escape from generic here is restraint executed with craft, not added visual interest |
| Emil Kowalski, *Animations on the Web* | [`motion`](../skills/motion/SKILL.md) | Duration by interaction class, exits faster, ease-out default, compositor properties only. Overridden wherever it meets "motion may never alter a colour" |
| Impeccable · shadcn conventions | [`build-ui`](../skills/build-ui/SKILL.md) | Type-scale contrast, tracking by size, measure, proximity-before-size, tabular numerals |

Provenance recorded in [`NOTICE.md`](../../NOTICE.md). No third-party code is vendored.

### Gates

```
Ran:      state ✓  — 13 checks, 1 known warning
NOT run:  everything else. Still no application code.
```

### Next

1. Design the remaining R1 surfaces to the approved system — Palette Studio, Finder results,
   the share card, Compare, Home — plus Flows B and C.
2. Settle Radix vs Base UI.
3. Then F-001.

Nothing is `in_progress` in the feature list.

## 2026-08-14 — Phase 2a: Stage 1 wireframes, R1 web

**Scope:** the design tooling decision, and the first wireframe deliverable. No code.

### Done

**[ADR-0032](../../docs/adr/0032-design-in-claude-wireframes-before-visual-before-code.md)** —
design is produced in Claude rather than Figma, and the deliverable splits into three
separately-approved stages: **wireframes → visual design → code**.

The staging is the substantive part. A single combined design review collapses two different
questions, and feedback about type weight arrives before anyone has agreed what is on the
page. It matters more here than usual because half the hard constraints in the design brief
are about what colour does to perception (C1, C6, C7) — which cannot be judged from a
wireframe, while structural questions cannot be judged once the page is full of colour.

`DESIGN-BRIEF.md` §7 rewritten to match: it now specifies the three stages, what is approved
at each, and the greyscale rule with its one exception.

**Stage 1 wireframes delivered** — R1 web, published as an inspectable artifact:

- Colour detail (`/colors/[slug]`) — desktop and mobile, 11 annotations. Designed first
  because every other surface reuses its parts.
- Colour Atlas · Colour Lens (permission → live → result) · Compare · Home
- Flow A as an annotated six-step sequence with p50 budgets
- Eight component states, including the ones usually left blank: loading, no-results,
  camera-denied, offline, poor-confidence, focus-visible
- Six decisions surfaced explicitly for the reviewer, each with the alternative I did not take

**The greyscale rule and its exception.** Wireframes are greyscale except where a colour
*sample* appears — a sample is content, not decoration, and **C1 is only testable if you can
see a garment colour sitting inside the chrome.** The document's own chrome follows the
product's rule: one chromatic value in the entire page, a muted moss used only for annotation
markers, chosen because the samples shown are indigo-family and a reviewer's eye must never
conflate an annotation with a colour under examination.

### Gates

```
Ran:      state ✓  (node scripts/verify-state.mjs) — 13 checks, 1 known warning
NOT run:  everything else. Still no application code.
```

Verified after the ADR and brief edits: 33 ADRs, index consistent; 172 governed documents,
all links resolve.

### Recorded, not resolved

- The **perceptual Atlas arrangement** (annotation 2.3) is the largest open question. It may
  be the most distinctive thing on the site or an unnavigable novelty; it needs a stage-2
  prototype before we commit either way.
- **Colour values in the wireframes are placeholders.** Real corpus entries land with F-012,
  each with complete provenance and a named reviewer. Nothing in the deliverable is a
  verified colour claim, and the document says so.

### Next

1. **Review the wireframes.** Feedback references annotation numbers.
2. On approval: wireframe the remaining R1 surfaces — Palette Studio, Finder results, the
   shareable card — plus Flows B and C. Held until after this review so a structural
   correction lands before they are drawn rather than after.
3. Then stage 2 (visual design), then F-001.

Nothing is `in_progress` in the feature list. Design work precedes R0.

## 2026-08-13 — Phase 1: product definition and harness

**Scope:** convert the four brainstorm documents into a production-grade documentation set
and build the working system that will govern every subsequent change. No application code.

### Done

**Brand.** Irodora, from 彩り (*irodori*), "the arrangement of colours". Namespace verified
free before locking: `.com .io .app .co .net .org .design`, npm `@irodora`, GitHub
`irodora`. Kasane was the stronger concept and lost on the exact-match `.com`.

**Decisions settled with the user:** monorepo + modular monolith with named extraction
triggers · web first, mobile close behind · container-portable deployment with Coolify and
Dokploy as a first-class VPS target and AWS as the managed one.

**Documentation** — `docs/`:

- `PRD.md` — 68 FR and 24 NFR, each testable, each owned by a release; personas, six
  journeys, monetisation, metrics with targets, non-goals with reasons.
- `REQUIREMENTS-COVERAGE.md` — requirement → feature → gate, machine-checked.
- `roadmap.md`, `glossary.md`.
- `architecture/` — ARCHITECTURE, color-engine, data-model, api-contract, sync-protocol,
  security/threat-model, security/privacy-design.
- `adr/` — 31 records plus template and index.
- `design/` — BRAND, DESIGN-BRIEF (the input to the design phase), DESIGN-SYSTEM,
  ACCESSIBILITY, and the token manifest.
- `content/` — corpus spec and the licensing position.
- `compliance/data-governance.md`; `operations/` including per-platform deployment runbooks.

**Harness** — `.harness/`: AGENTS.md, 3 instruction docs, 13 rule files across 8 areas,
7 protocols, 8 governance documents, 23 skills, 8 commands, the plan template.

**Adapter** — `.claude/`: settings, 6 subagents (planner · generator · evaluator ·
color-scientist · designer · security-reviewer), and content-free shims for every command
and skill.

**Verification** — 16 gates defined in `gates.json` with activation triggers;
`scripts/verify-state.mjs` written and green; `.github/workflows/ci.yml` mirroring the
gates, with the mirror itself checked.

**State** — 66 features across R0–R5, R0–R2 fully specified with acceptance criteria;
10 seed effect links, each with its narrative note and named guard; memory seeded with
2 decisions, 9 lessons, 10 effect notes, 1 glossary entry, 1 product note.

### Deliberate departures from the brainstorm

1. **"Non-AI" became a four-tier capability policy** (ADR-0002). The blanket ban was
   unenforceable and would have outlawed the classical CV the Lens needs. The guarantee is
   now testable: disable tiers 1–3 and the product still answers.
2. **Measurement provenance is a type, not a disclaimer** (ADR-0005). A disclaimer is
   optional at every call site; a required field is not.
3. **Web is a first-class surface**, not a companion — the Atlas is the public proof of the
   engine.
4. **en/ja from day one** (ADR-0028). Retrofitting Japanese typography means redesigning.
5. **A real licensing position on colour data** (ADR-0007) — clean-room corpus, per-entry
   provenance, Wada as inspiration only.
6. **Ethical guardrails** (NFR-22, NFR-23) — no dermatological, ethnic or attractiveness
   inference, plus ITA-stratified bias validation as a release blocker.
7. **Monetisation defined** (ADR-0027), with accessibility permanently outside every paywall.
8. **Honest crypto language** — envelope encryption is described as what it is, and never as
   end-to-end.

### Gates

```
Ran:      state ✓  (node scripts/verify-state.mjs)
NOT run:  typecheck, lint, format, test, color-golden, build, e2e, a11y, contrast,
          cvd, content, perf, web-perf, e2e-full, security
Why:      no application code exists yet. Those gates activate with the features
          recorded in gates.json (`activatesWith`), starting at F-001.
```

Gate 0 is not a placeholder: it validates both state files against their committed schemas,
the effect graph and its memory pairing, path existence, guard coverage on critical links,
requirement traceability in both directions, the ADR index, the CI mirror, the env contract,
the golden-rule scan across scoped harnesses, and every relative link in every governed
document.

### Known and recorded

- `E-009` (rule weights) carries `guard: "none"` with `feature: F-029`. The graph is
  honestly reporting a check we owe rather than hiding it behind a lowered severity.
- Four open questions block the features that depend on them: OQ-1 (OIDC provider, R2),
  OQ-2 (billing, R4), OQ-3 (reference card, R4), OQ-4 and OQ-5 (corpus seed size and
  Japanese editorial reviewer, R1).
- Four gate blind spots recorded in `memory/observations.md`, including that
  `verify-state.mjs` implements a JSON Schema **subset** and reports its unsupported
  keywords rather than silently passing them.
- **The workstation runs Node 22.16.0.** `.nvmrc` pins 24.19.0. Gate 0 runs on 22; `pnpm
  install` will fail the engine check. Upgrade before F-001.

### Next

1. **UI design phase** — `docs/design/DESIGN-BRIEF.md` is the input. On approval, the token
   values land in `design-system.manifest.json` and its status moves from `placeholder` to
   `approved`, which makes the contrast gate blocking.
2. **Then F-001** (monorepo toolchain scaffold) via `/next-feature` → `/plan`.

Nothing is `in_progress`. The next session starts with `/next-feature`.
